    "# Background \n",
    "\n",
    "Gender achievement gaps in education have been well-documented over the years -- studies consistently find boys outperforming girls on math tests and girls outperforming boys on reading and language tests. A particularly controversial [article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1684489) was published in Science in 1980 arguing that this pattern was due to an 'innate' difference in ability (focusing on mathematics rather than on reading and language). Such views persisted in part because studying systematic patterns in achievement nationwide was a challenge due to differential testing standards across school districts and the general lack of availability of large-scale data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is only recently that data-driven research has begun to reveal socioeconomic drivers of achievement gaps. The [Standford Educational Data Archive](https://edopportunity.org/) (SEDA), a publicly available database on academic achievement and educational opportunity in U.S. schools, has supported this effort. The database is part of a broader initiave aiming to improve educational opportunity by enabling researchers and policymakers to identify systemic drivers of disparity.\n",
    "\n",
    "> SEDA includes a range of detailed data on educational conditions, contexts, and outcomes in school districts and counties across the United States. It includes measures of academic achievement and achievement gaps for school districts and counties, as well as district-level measures of racial and socioeconomic composition, racial and socioeconomic segregation patterns, and other features of the schooling system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The database standardizes average test scores for schools 10,000 U.S. school districts relative to national standards to allow comparability between school districts and across grade levels and years. The test score data come from the U.S. Department of Education. In addition, multiple data sources (American Community Survey and Common Core of Data) are integrated to provide district-level socioeconomic and demographic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [study of the SEDA data published in 2018](https://cepa.stanford.edu/content/gender-achievement-gaps-us-school-districts) identified the following persistent patterns across grade levels 3 - 8 and school ears from 2008 through 2015:\n",
    "* a consistent reading and language achievement gap favoring girls;\n",
    "* *no* national math achievement gap on average; and\n",
    "* local math achievement gaps that depend on the socioeconomic conditions of school districts.\n",
    "You can read about the main findings of the study in this [brief NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/13/upshot/boys-girls-math-reading-tests.html).\n",
    "\n",

It is reasonable to infer that rural areas to be more likely to have missing data, as there is often little communication between rural places and the state government, primarily due to the state government's structure. Most rural areas are \"lower income\" compared to places such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, so there will be potential bias in that regard."

    "* Reading gaps consistently favor girls across all socioeconomic levels and grade levels, with relatively flat gradients showing minimal sensitivity to socioeconomic conditions.\n",

    "* Variable direction: The math gap fluctuates, sometimes favoring girls, sometimes boys, or showing parity, depending on grade level and income level.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Consistent income gradient: The slope stays the same across all levels — as income rises, the gap usually shifts in favor of boys (or toward equality).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variable baseline gap: The starting point at low-income levels varies widely by grade, ranging from parity (grade 4) to significant gaps favoring girls (grades 6 and 8).\n",

    "Grade-specific pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Grade 4: Gender parity at low-income levels, but a gap emerges favoring boys as income increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Grade 5: Initial gap slightly favors girls, though not significantly, converges to parity around middle-income levels, then shifts to favor boys\n",
    "\n",
    "* Grade 6: Large initial gap favoring girls, equalizes by middle-income, slight boy advantage at high-income.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Grade 7: Moderate initial gap favoring girls, then converges to parity by middle-income levels, with minimal differences at high income.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Grade 8: Substantial initial gap favoring girls, maintaining a slight girl advantage through middle income levels, then converging to parity at high income.\n",
    "  \n",
    "While the income gradient stays consistent across grades 4-8, the baseline gender gap at low-income levels varies significantly by grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Highly sensitive to socioeconomic status** (significant income gradient effect)\n",
    "2. **Gender advantage varies** across different grade and income levels.\n",
    "3. **Baseline gap varies** (different baseline gaps at each grade level)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading Gap Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "* Consistent trend: Girls outperform boys in reading at all grade and income levels.\n",

    "This analysis helps us determine whether socioeconomic factors affect gender-based differences in academic performance. This approach differs significantly from our previous grade-by-grade analysis in several key ways: while our earlier study used continuous income measures to track how gaps changed along income levels within each specific grade (4-8), this analysis combines math performance across all grades to produce an overall district-level gap score. It then groups districts into distinct income brackets and classifies gap outcomes as favoring boys, girls, or neither. Instead of focusing on slopes and baseline differences across developmental stages, we are now exploring whether entire school districts in different economic contexts exhibit systematically different patterns in their overall gender achievement gaps.\n",
